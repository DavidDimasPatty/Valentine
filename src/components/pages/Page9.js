        Happy Valentine’s Day, my love. 
        You make my life brighter and my heart happier every single day. 
        I’m so grateful for every moment we share together. 
        Being with you feels like home and my favorite adventure at the same time. 
        I love you more than words can ever explain. Happy Valentine’s, once again.
